Then, how to develop a business with web scrapping? Well, in this article I want to share with you about the benefits of web scrapping before discussing web scrapping techniques which may be discussed in other articles. However, knowing more about its benefits is also very important.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="/assets/img/scrapping/scraping.jpeg" alt="Desktop View" /></p><h2 id="what-is-web-scraping">What is Web Scraping?</h2><p>But, before discussing the benefits of web scrapping, we need to know what web scrapping is? Well, web scrapping refers to the creation or use of computer software to collect data from all competitor websites or several competitor website pages.</p><p>Even when doing web scrapping, you can download all website pages and also things related to the main aspects of a competitor’s website such as tags (titles) or the content of articles on the website for further analysis needs.</p><h2 id="web-scrapping-techniques">Web Scrapping Techniques</h2><p>Now everything has been made easier, to do your web scrapping has been facilitated by the existence of an extension in the browser and also the application. However, the results are not as good as the manual method and using coding. Well, in this article, we will briefly discuss web scrapping techniques and there are more or less six commonly used web scrapping techniques, including:</p><h2 id="getting-data-manually">Getting Data Manually</h2><p>This is one of the simplest techniques where you can get other website data manually. This technique is quite time consuming, because you have to retrieve and also store the information that has been obtained one by one.</p><h2 id="regular-expression-technique">Regular Expression Technique</h2><p>One of the benefits of using this technique is the consistency of the syntax in various programming languages. This technique is a flexible technique. Plus by using this technique, you can get data by type such as price, product name and email address.</p><h2 id="html-parsing-techniques">HTML Parsing Techniques</h2><p>This method is done by sending an HTTP request to the server that stores the website data. By using this technique, you are not only doing web scrapping to websites that are static in nature.</p><p>You can also get large amounts of data, but the drawback is that this technique can be prevented with a website protection. In fact, you can also be blocked from certain sites when you frequently use this technique.</p><h2 id="techniques-for-using-google-sheets">Techniques for Using Google Sheets</h2><p>We know it as a Google application that is used to create spreadsheet files. Apparently, not only for these needs. You can also use Google Sheets to do web scrapping very easily.</p><p>In addition to google sheets, you also need a browser that has the inspect element feature. Then, just copy the XPath expression from the website page element whose data you want to get into an IMPORTXML command which is usually already available in Google Sheets.</p><h2 id="benefits-of-web-scrapping">Benefits of Web Scrapping</h2><p>Furthermore, after getting to know what web scrapping is and the techniques that are often used, below are 5 benefits that you can get with web scrapping:</p><h3 id="monitoring-competitors">Monitoring Competitors</h3><p>The e-Commerce market in Indonesia has indeed made a big spike, especially during the current pandemic and this digital retail market will continue to grow as digital devices can increasingly be integrated into our real lives and can change consumer behavior in shopping.</p><p>The target market is getting easier to reach, but the competition is getting tougher and not a few feel that the digital space is getting narrower for new entrants. Is there a way for the business to survive? Then you need to study your competitors, as one of the ancient Chinese generals who we often know him with Sun Tzu said that “If you know your enemy and yourself, then you will never be defeated by him.” Well, this also applies in business.</p><p>You can get data and also get to know competitors so you can make changes, namely by web scrapping techniques. As explained earlier that web scrapping is a technique to get information from products on competitor websites/e-commerce sites, so with this data you can determine new strategies so you don’t lose to competitors.</p><p>In addition to products, you can also get advertising data for competitor products in the form of budget insights and so on. In fact, you can also get data in the form of product trend predictions.</p><h3 id="price-optimization">Price Optimization</h3><p>If you are an entrepreneur who has difficulty setting prices, then you can get price optimization from web scrapping techniques and this is very helpful. The problem with optimization is that we can’t balance the point where we can’t increase profits without losing customers.</p><p>Remember the principle that customers are willing to pay more for a product with more value. Whereas in the digital retail business, it is important to improve your services where your competitors don’t exist and this is where web scrapping plays a role.</p><p>With web scarpping you can get customer-related information, so you can find out how you can get increased customer satisfaction with your offer, one way is by refining your market strategy.</p><p>With web scrapping too, you can set a dynamic pricing strategy. The digital business market is not static and you have to keep up with all the price changes that occur to maximize a service and profit. Web Scraping allows you to monitor changes in market prices and strategies for proper promotion.</p><h3 id="personally-targeted">Personally Targeted</h3><p>Web scrapping can make it easier for you to set personal targets based on your prospective customer data, so you can determine how to promote them. Usually the data you can get from web scraping is in the form of education of prospective customers, companies, their positions, gender and much more.</p><p>With this data you can determine campaign strategies and you can also determine relevant niches to implement campaigns and send newsletters in bulk. However, make sure you always send information that is relevant to the interests of your customers.</p><h3 id="investing-decision">Investing Decision</h3><p>Web scrapping in the world of investment is not uncommon anymore. In fact, from time to time, many people have used web scrapping techniques to collect alternative data to avoid the risk of failure and this can help in detecting unexpected risks and more potential opportunities.</p><p>Investment decisions are complex, because they usually involve a series of processes before deciding on the right step in preparing an investment decision. The most effective way to test past investments is through analysis of historical data. This can show you the causes of failure and success in investing in the past.</p><p>As a means, web scrapping can extract historical data more effectively where you can enter the data into a database. So that investment companies by using the data that have been obtained can increase the accuracy of the results of their analysis by using this large data to increase the accuracy of the results of their analysis in making better decisions.</p><h3 id="optimizing-products">Optimizing Products</h3><p>It makes sense for anyone who searches for online reviews of a product before making a purchase. These reviews can influence a prospective customer’s purchase decision on our product deterministically. Therefore, we can analyze what our potential customers think of us to match their expectations.</p><p>Say your product team is about to launch an assisted product. However, you are very worried about this new product and wonder if your latest product can make a breakthrough and help generate cash for your company or not. Well, it’s important to collect customer feedback to cross-check your product and make an improvement if a flaw is found.</p><p>You can use sentiment analysis techniques more broadly to analyze the attitude of our customers, whether it can have a positive, neutral or even negative impact. However, this analysis requires a large amount of data. So that the process of collecting this big data becomes faster and saves a lot of time and energy, you can use web scrapping.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/webapp/'>WebApp</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/webscrapping/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >webscrapping</a> <a href="/tags/techniques/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Techniques</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://0x3n0.us"> 0x3n0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What is Web Scraping and its Benefits - 0x3n0&url=https://0x.3n0.us/webscrapping/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=What is Web Scraping and its Benefits - 0x3n0&u=https://0x.3n0.us/webscrapping/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=What is Web Scraping and its Benefits - 0x3n0&url=https://0x.3n0.us/webscrapping/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://0x.3n0.us/webscrapping/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Linkedin"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-linkedin"></i> </a> <a href="http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?title=What is Web Scraping and its Benefits - 0x3n0&url=https://0x.3n0.us/webscrapping/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Weibo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Weibo"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-weibo"></i> </a> <a href="https://lineit.line.me/share/ui?url=https://0x.3n0.us/webscrapping/&text=What is Web Scraping and its Benefits - 0x3n0" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Line" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Line"> <i class="fa-fw iconfont icon-13"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Update</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/lack-of-resources-&-rate-limiting/">OWASP API Security Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting</a><li><a href="/cyberwarfare/">The invisible war</a><li><a href="/Postman-Writeup/">Postman Writeup</a><li><a href="/Traverxec-Writeup/">Traverxec Writeup</a><li><a href="/Resolute-Writeup/">Resolute Writeup</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"> <span>Trending Tags</span><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/writeup/">writeup</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/oscp-prep/">oscp-prep</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/htb-linux-easy/">htb-linux-easy</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/htb-windows-easy/">htb-windows-easy</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/reverse-shell/">reverse-shell</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/hashcat/">hashcat</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/metasploit/">metasploit</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/c/">C++</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/msfvenom/">msfvenom</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/programming/">Programming</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"> <span class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</span><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div class="post-navigation d-flex justify-content-between"> <a href="/thm-attacking-kerberos/" class="btn btn-outline-primary" prompt="Older"><p>TryHackMe - Attacking Kerberos</p></a> <a href="/Causes-and-How-to-Solve-bugs/" class="btn btn-outline-primary" prompt="Newer"><p>Get to know Bugs Causes and How to Solve them</p></a></div><div id="vcomments"></div><script> new Valine({ el: '#vcomments', appId: 'FWkEX16hdTMRmYzFQeIqS4GH-MdYXbMMI', appKey: 'ihjgIDYfMOWOfiX7hkrQrGXR', placeholder:'Your Comments.', avatar: 'wavatar', lang: 'en', enableQQ: true });
